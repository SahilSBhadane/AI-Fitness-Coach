## 🎮 Usage

### For Individual Users
1. Position your camera to capture full body
2. Select your exercise
3. Start your set
4. Receive real-time feedback on form

### For Developers (API Integration)
```python
import requests

# Analyze pose
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/analyze', 
    json={'exercise': 'squat', 'frame': image_data})

feedback = response.json()['feedback']
accuracy_score = response.json()['score']
```

---

## 📈 API Endpoints
```
POST /api/analyze
- Analyzes exercise form from video frame
- Returns: feedback, score, joint angles

GET /api/exercises
- Lists all supported exercises
- Returns: exercise list with requirements

POST /api/session
- Starts a workout session
- Returns: session_id for tracking
```

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

1. **Gym Chains** – Reduce liability and improve member retention
2. **Fitness Apps** – Add form-checking feature to mobile apps
3. **Personal Trainers** – Scale coaching to more clients
4. **Home Workouts** – Safe training without a trainer present
5. **Physical Therapy** – Monitor exercise compliance and form
